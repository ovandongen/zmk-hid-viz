# zmk-hid-viz

A ZMK firmware module that sends real-time layer-state and key-event notifications to a host visualization app, and accepts commands from the host. Runs on top of the [zmk-raw-hid](https://github.com/zzeneg/zmk-raw-hid) transport module.

## What it does

- **Layer notifications**: Every layer change (`&mo`, `&lt`, `&tog`, `&to`, combos, tap-dance — everything) is reported to the host in real time.
- **Key event notifications**: Every physical key press and release is reported with its matrix position.
- **Command handling**: The host app can query device info and control the active layer state.

Transport (USB + BLE) is handled entirely by zmk-raw-hid; this module only consumes its `raw_hid_received_event` / `raw_hid_sent_event` events.

## Installation

Add both modules to your `config/west.yml`:

```yaml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: zzeneg
      url-base: https://github.com/zzeneg
    - name: ovandongen
      url-base: https://github.com/ovandongen
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: zmk-raw-hid
      remote: zzeneg
      revision: main
    - name: zmk-hid-viz
      remote: ovandongen
      revision: main
  self:
    path: config
```

Add to your `.conf` file:

```
CONFIG_RAW_HID=y
CONFIG_HID_VIZ=y
```

Both lines are required — `CONFIG_RAW_HID` enables the transport (provided by `zmk-raw-hid`) and `CONFIG_HID_VIZ` enables the messaging layer on top of it.

Add the `raw_hid_adapter` shield (provided by zmk-raw-hid) to your left/central half in `build.yaml`:

```yaml
include:
  - board: your_board_lh
    shield: raw_hid_adapter
  - board: your_board_rh
```

## Configuration

All options in your `.conf` file:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `CONFIG_HID_VIZ` | n | Enable the module |
| `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_LAYER_EVENTS` | y | Send layer state notifications |
| `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_KEY_EVENTS` | y | Send key press/release events |
| `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_COMMANDS` | y | Accept commands from host app |
| `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_RGB` | n | RGB profile: handle `0xD1` set commands, emit `0xD0` change receipts (requires `CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW=y`) |
| `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_SIGNAL` | n | Signal behaviors: fire opaque host-defined `0xC0` triggers on key press |
| `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_CONFIG_ID` | "" | Layout/config identifier returned by the `0xFB` query |

Raw HID transport options (`CONFIG_RAW_HID_USAGE_PAGE`, `CONFIG_RAW_HID_USAGE`, `CONFIG_RAW_HID_REPORT_SIZE`, `CONFIG_RAW_HID_DEVICE`) are owned by zmk-raw-hid — see its README for defaults and tuning.

## Message Protocol

### Outbound (keyboard → host)

**Layer state** (byte[0] = `0xFF`):
| Byte | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `0xFF` | Message type |
| 1 | `0x04` | Width of each bitmask field (bytes) |
| 2-5 | uint32 (LE) | Default layer bitmask (layers 0-31) |
| 6-9 | uint32 (LE) | Active layer bitmask (layers 0-31) |

**Key event** (byte[0] = `0xF1`):
| Byte | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `0xF1` | Message type |
| 2 | uint8 | Key matrix position |
| 3 | 0/1 | 0 = released, 1 = pressed |

**Device info response** (byte[0] = `0xFE`):
| Byte | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `0xFE` | Message type |
| 1 | uint8 | Protocol version |
| 2+ | string | Board/keyboard name (null-terminated) |

**Config ID response** (byte[0] = `0xFA`):
| Byte | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `0xFA` | Message type |
| 1+ | string | Layout/config ID from `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_CONFIG_ID` (null-terminated, empty if unset) |

**RGB changed** (byte[0] = `0xD0`, requires `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_RGB`):
| Byte | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `0xD0` | Message type (`core.rgb.changed`) |
| 1 | 0/1 | Underglow on/off |
| 2-3 | uint16 (LE) | Hue (0-359) |
| 4 | uint8 | Saturation (0-100) |
| 5 | uint8 | Brightness (0-100) |
| 6 | uint8 | Effect index |

Sent as the receipt after every `0xD1` set. Stock ZMK has no HSB/effect getter,
so h/s/v/effect reflect the last value set *through this module*; changes made
by `&rgb_ug` keymap behaviours bypass it and desync the report (on/off is
always live). When the effect index selects a per-key/layer mode (fork
firmware), the reported hue/saturation are dormant — treat them as advisory.

### Inbound (host → keyboard)

**Get device info** (byte[0] = `0xFD`): Keyboard responds with `0xFE` device info message.

**Get config ID** (byte[0] = `0xFB`): Keyboard responds with `0xFA` config ID message. Host apps use this to auto-load the matching layout definition; an empty string means manual layout selection.

**Set layer state** (byte[0] = `0xFC`):
| Byte | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `0xFC` | Command type |
| 1-4 | uint32 (LE) | Layer state bitmask (bit N = layer N active, for layers 0-31) |

Layer 0 is always active regardless of the bitmask. The keyboard deactivates all
other layers and then activates every layer whose bit is set, allowing the host
to restore a complete layer stack rather than a single layer.

**RGB set** (byte[0] = `0xD1`, requires `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_RGB`):
| Byte | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `0xD1` | Command type (`core.rgb.set`) |
| 1 | bitmask | Fields present: bit0=on, bit1=h, bit2=s, bit3=v, bit4=effect |
| 2 | 0/1 | Underglow on/off |
| 3-4 | uint16 (LE) | Hue (0-359) |
| 5 | uint8 | Saturation (0-100) |
| 6 | uint8 | Brightness (0-100) |
| 7 | uint8 | Effect index |

Absolute and idempotent. Byte positions are fixed; bytes whose mask bit is
clear are ignored and the corresponding setting keeps its current value.
Colour/effect are applied before on/off, so `{on=1, h, s, v}` switches on
showing the new colour. The keyboard always replies with a `0xD0` changed
receipt — sending an empty mask (`0x00`) applies nothing and therefore acts
as a state query. Per-key colour is deliberately not exposed: on ZMK the
per-key picture derives locally from layer state, so hosts change it with the
layer commands above (`0xD2` / `core.rgb.setKey` is reserved for QMK RGB
Matrix devices).

## Emit behavior (originator)

The optional `&hid_viz_emit` behavior lets a key emit a capability action onto the
bus, fire-and-forget — e.g. a keyboard telling a trackball to change its DPI. The
keyboard never waits for or learns the outcome; it observes the resulting
`*.changed` event if it cares. With no fulfiller present, the emit is a silent
no-op.

Enable it in your `.conf`:

```
CONFIG_HID_VIZ_EMIT=y
```

Add the behavior node to your keymap and bind it (the action constants come from
the module's `dt-bindings` header):

```dts
#include <dt-bindings/hid_viz/emit.h>

/ {
    behaviors {
        hid_viz_emit: hid_viz_emit {
            compatible = "zmk,behavior-hid-viz-emit";
            #binding-cells = <2>;
        };
    };
};
```

Then use it in any layer. First parameter = action, second = a uint32 value:

```dts
&hid_viz_emit POINTING_DPI_SET 800        // -> 0xE1, value 800 (LE)
&hid_viz_emit POINTING_DRAGSCROLL_SET 1   // -> 0xE9, value 1
```

Available action constants: `POINTING_DPI_SET` (0xE1), `POINTING_DPI_SETINDEX`
(0xE2), `POINTING_DRAGSCROLL_SET` (0xE9), `POINTING_SNIPE_SET` (0xEB). The wire
message is `[action, value_uint32_le]` — the same type byte the fulfilling
device's handler consumes. This device lists each emitted action under
`triggers`; routing an emit to a handler is the host hub's job.

### Fixed form (devicetree-configured, editor-friendly)

The 2-cell form above needs a `#include` and two keymap parameters on the key,
which the **MoErgo Glove80 Layout Editor** can't place. For that workflow there's
a **zero-cell** sibling, `zmk,behavior-hid-viz-emit-fixed`: the action and value
live on the node as devicetree properties, so you paste one node into the editor's
*custom behaviors / custom devicetree* box and bind it by label — no include, no
parameters on the key.

```dts
/ {
    behaviors {
        dpi_800: dpi_800 {
            compatible = "zmk,behavior-hid-viz-emit-fixed";
            #binding-cells = <0>;
            action = "core.pointing.dpi.set";   // string enum (capability ID)
            value  = <800>;                       // uint32, sent little-endian
        };
    };
};
```

Then bind `&dpi_800` on any key. `action` is one of the capability ID strings
`"core.pointing.dpi.set"`, `"core.pointing.dpi.setIndex"`,
`"core.pointing.dragScroll.set"`, `"core.pointing.snipe.set"` (mapped to the same
wire bytes as the constants above; an unknown string fails the devicetree build).
Both forms share `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_EMIT` and the same `[action, value_uint32_le]`
wire message. Each fixed node also self-registers its action under `triggers` in
the manifest automatically — declare the node and the device advertises it.

## Signal behavior (generic host triggers)

The optional `&signal` behavior fires an **opaque host-defined id** onto the bus on
key press, fire-and-forget. Unlike emit (which references a *device* capability like
DPI), a signal means nothing on the wire — it just says "id N happened." The
listening host maps the id to whatever it likes (launch an app, run a script, focus
a window). New actions are pure host config; no reflash. See
[docs/signal-capability-spec.md](docs/signal-capability-spec.md) for the full design.

Wire message (byte[0] = `0xC0`):
| Byte | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `0xC0` | Message type (`signal.fire`) |
| 1 | uint8 | Opaque id (meaning is host config) |

Enable it in your `.conf`:

```
CONFIG_HID_VIZ_SIGNAL=y
```

**1-cell form** — flexible, one parameter is the id:

```dts
/ {
    behaviors {
        signal: signal {
            compatible = "zmk,behavior-hid-signal";
            #binding-cells = <1>;
        };
    };
};
```

```dts
&signal 7      // -> 0xC0, id 7   ("build")
&signal 12     // -> 0xC0, id 12  ("open browser")
```

Put signal keys on a dedicated layer so they don't also type. The id here is a
keymap parameter the firmware can't enumerate, so this form advertises only the
bare `signal.fire` capability in the manifest ("I fire signals").

**Fixed form (devicetree-configured, editor-friendly + enumerated)** — like the
emit fixed form, the id lives on a zero-cell node, so it pastes into the **MoErgo
Glove80 Layout Editor** and, additionally, each node self-registers an enumerated
`signal.fire/<id>` entry in the manifest. A host scanning the keyboard then sees
*exactly which ids it fires* — e.g. `signal.fire/7`, `signal.fire/12` — instead of
an opaque "fires signals."

```dts
/ {
    behaviors {
        signal_7: signal_7 {
            compatible = "zmk,behavior-hid-signal-fixed";
            #binding-cells = <0>;
            id = <7>;
        };
    };
};
```

Then bind `&signal_7` on any key. Both forms share `CONFIG_HID_VIZ_SIGNAL` and the
same `[0xC0, id]` wire message.

**Security:** the host's id → action map is trusted, user-owned local config. The
wire only ever *references* a slot the user already defined; it can never define
one — so a keyboard can never inject an arbitrary command, only fire an id you
already mapped. Treat any device that can write the raw-HID report as able to fire
any configured id (fine for a local USB/BLE keyboard).
